1.Why Python its called dynamically ececuted language?

Python is dynamically executed language it execute the code at runtine unlike other programing languagesa like C,C++, and Java python execute the code at runtime for example we dont need to declare the type of the variable becuse python determine that at runtime 
so we can write
```
   x="kanishka"  \\string
   x=10   \\ int
```
 So in short we dont need to decalre the variable type it will determine at runtime
